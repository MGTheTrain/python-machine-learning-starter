## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture of our project. It outlines the main components, their interactions, and the overall structure of the system.

## System Components

### 1. User Interface (UI)

The User Interface is the front-end of the application where users interact with the system. It is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.

### 2. API Gateway

The API Gateway acts as an entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate services, handles authentication, and implements rate limiting. It is typically built using a framework like Express.js for Node.js or Flask for Python.

### 3. Microservices

The system is divided into several microservices, each responsible for a specific business capability. Each microservice is designed to be independently deployable and scalable. Common microservices include:

- **User Service**: Manages user authentication, profiles, and roles.
- **Product Service**: Handles product catalog, inventory, and pricing.
- **Order Service**: Manages customer orders, order processing, and history.

### 4. Database

The database layer consists of several databases, each dedicated to a specific microservice. This ensures data isolation and scalability. Common databases used include:

- **Relational Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra

### 5. Message Broker

A message broker is used for asynchronous communication between microservices. It helps in decoupling services and ensures reliable message delivery. Popular message brokers include RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and NATS.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining the health and performance of the system. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring, while ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for centralized logging.

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: The user initiates a request through the UI.
2. **API Gateway**: The API Gateway receives the request, authenticates it, and routes it to the appropriate microservice.
3. **Microservice Processing**: The microservice processes the request, interacting with the database and other services as needed.
4. **Database Interaction**: The microservice performs CRUD operations on its dedicated database.
5. **Message Broker**: If the request involves inter-service communication, the microservice publishes messages to the message broker.
6. **Response**: The microservice returns the response to the API Gateway, which then sends it back to the client.
7. **Monitoring and Logging**: All interactions are logged and monitored for performance and debugging purposes.

## Deployment

The system is deployed using containerization technologies like Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. This allows for scalable, resilient, and easy-to-manage deployments.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment of the application. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions are commonly used to implement CI/CD practices.

## Conclusion

This architecture overview provides a high-level understanding of the system's structure and components. Each component is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that the system can evolve and grow over time.
